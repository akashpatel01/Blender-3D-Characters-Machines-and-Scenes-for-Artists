Code Repository for Blender 3D: Characters Machines and Scenes for Artists, Published by Packt Publishing

##What You Will Learn:

*	Use your sculpting skills to carve the character features from the mesh
*	Find the best possible flow for your edge-loops to enhance the character features and to get the best possible range of deformation
*	Mix both the Blender Internal and Cycles rendering engines in order to render materials as quickly as possible
*	Know when and where to use various types of geometryâ€”something that saves time in one instance will pose significant problems in another
*	Create a 3D robot toy model from start to finish using the basic modeling tools of Blender
*	Make a full alien character using the skin mesh modifier and the sculpting tools with an artistic approach
*	Use re-topology techniques to create a clean 3D version of the previously sculpted alien
*	Integrate network resources with cross-platform applications
*	Model a full haunted house and its environment using more advanced modeling tools and techniques such as the Array Modifier, Instance duplication, and Curves

###Note
 Modules 1 and 3 have code arranged by chapter (for the chapters that have code). Module 2 has code laid out by platform. [Click here] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5qwunkGf6PUvzPirPDtuy1Du5Rlzew23UBp2S-P3wB-GcwQ/viewform) if you have any feedback or suggestions.
